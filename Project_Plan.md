Project Plan: Modular & Accessible Web Component Library

Project Vision To create a simple, private, and highly reusable "Lego block" system of web components. This system will empower internal teams (primarily marketing and content creators) to build accessible, responsive, and brand-consistent web pages quickly and without deep technical knowledge.
Target Audience
Primary Users: Internal team members who need to create or update web pages (e.g., for marketing campaigns, product updates, internal announcements).
Skill Level: Varies from non-technical (content editors) to semi-technical (power users). The system must be simple enough for a copy-paste workflow.
Future Contributors: Developers or technical team members who will add new components to the library over time.
Core Principles This project will be guided by the following principles:
Accessibility First: All components must be built to meet modern accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) from the start. This is non-negotiable.
Modularity: Every section is a self-contained, independent block. They can be stacked in any order to build a page.
Privacy-Oriented: The system will use zero external frameworks or libraries that could track user data. It will be 100% self-contained.
Ease of Use: The primary workflow for page builders will be copying a single template and then copying the HTML for the sections they need.
Responsiveness: All components must be mobile-first and display perfectly on all screen sizes, from phones to desktops.
Key Features & Components The system will consist of two parts: the components themselves and the internal library tool used to manage them. Initial Component Set:
Header (with product/company logos)
Footer (with disclaimers)
Video Player (Centered, Split Left, Split Right) with Transcript functionality
Banners (Full Width CTA, Full Screen Image)
3-Column Features
Team Bios
Step-by-Step Process Guide
Image Gallery
Testimonial/Quote Block
FAQ Accordion The Component Library Tool:
A visual interface showing a preview of every component.
Functionality to copy the clean HTML for any component.
A one-click "Copy Full Page Template" button that provides a ready-to-use HTML file with the stylesheet and interactive scripts included.
Hosted as a private website using GitHub Pages, accessible only to invited team members.
Technology Stack
Languages: HTML5, CSS3 (with CSS Variables for easy theming), and Vanilla JavaScript for light interactivity (no jQuery or frameworks).
Hosting & Version Control: A private GitHub repository.
Deployment: GitHub Pages, with access control restricted to repository collaborators.
